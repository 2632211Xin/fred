## Let's ask some LLM's

For both test the math portion has a few very difficult questions that expect people to know some tricks for exponenets and series calculation. can you make a list of the math tricks that help students with the harder math questions.

Sure, I can put my reply in markdown format. Here is the same list of math tricks in a more structured way:

Squaring numbers ending in 5: To square a two-digit number ending in 5, multiply the first digit by itself plus one, and then append 25 to the result. For example, to square 35, multiply 3 by 4 and get 12, and then add 25 to get 1225. This works for any two-digit number ending in 5.
Multiplying by 11: To multiply a two-digit number by 11, add the two digits and place the sum between them. If the sum is greater than 9, carry over the extra digit to the left. For example, to multiply 47 by 11, add 4 and 7 and get 11, and then place it between 4 and 7 to get 4117. Since the sum is greater than 9, carry over the extra 1 to the left and get 517 as the final answer.
Divisibility rules: There are some simple rules to check whether a number is divisible by another number without doing long division. For example, a number is divisible by 2 if it ends in an even digit, by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4, by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5, by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3, by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9, and by 10 if it ends in 0.
Exponent rules: There are some basic rules for simplifying expressions involving exponents. For example, xa * xb = x(a+b), xa / xb = x(a-b), (xa)b = x(ab), x-a = 1 / xa, x(1/a) = root(a)(x), and x(a/b) = root(b)(x)a.
Series formulas: There are some formulas for finding the sum of arithmetic and geometric series. An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive terms, such as 2, 5, 8, ... A geometric series is a sequence of numbers with a constant ratio between consecutive terms, such as 2, 6, 18, ... The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n * (a + l) / 2, where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a * (1 - r^n^) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.
I hope this markdown format helps you read the list better. ðŸ˜Š
