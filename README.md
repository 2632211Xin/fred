## Let's ask some LLM's

For both test the math portion has a few very difficult questions that expect people to know some tricks for exponenets and series calculation. can you make a list of the math tricks that help students with the harder math questions.

Here is bingChat's answer:




Certainly! Here are the helpful math tricks formatted in markdown:

### Squaring numbers ending in 5:
To square a two-digit number ending in 5, follow this rule:  
For a number like \(35^2\), multiply the first digit (3) by itself plus one (3 * (3 + 1)), and then append 25 to the result.  
Example: \(35^2 = 3 \times 4 = 12\), append 25 to get \(1225\). This works for any two-digit number ending in 5.

### Multiplying by 11:
To multiply a two-digit number by 11, follow this rule:  
Add the two digits and place the sum between them. If the sum is greater than 9, carry over the extra digit to the left.  
Example: \(47 \times 11 = 4 + 7 = 11\), so place 11 between 4 and 7 to get \(517\).

### Divisibility rules:
There are simple rules to check if a number is divisible by another number without doing long division:  
- Divisible by 2 if it ends in an even digit
- Divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3
- Divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4
- Divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5
- Divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3
- Divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9
- Divisible by 10 if it ends in 0

### Exponent rules:
There are basic rules for simplifying expressions involving exponents:

### Series formulas:

Certainly! Here are a few additional math tricks in markdown format:

### Square of Any Number:
To square a number close to a base number \(b\), you can use this formula: 
For example, to find \(42^2\), which is 2 more than 40 (a nice round number), use the formula: \((b + c) \times (b - c) + c^2\), where \(c\) is the difference between the number and the base. For \(42^2\), it's \((40 + 2) \times (40 - 2) + 2^2 = 1681\).

### Percentage Calculations:
To quickly find percentages of numbers, use shortcuts:
- To find 10% of a number, move the decimal point one place to the left.
- To find 1% of a number, move the decimal point two places to the left.
- To find 50% of a number, simply divide the number by 2.
- To find 25% of a number, divide it by 4.

### Finding Multiples:
For finding multiples of numbers:
- To find multiples of 5, take the last digit and double it.
- To find multiples of 9, the sum of the digits should be divisible by 9.

### Checking Prime Numbers:
To quickly check if a number is a prime number:
- Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of the number. If it's not divisible by any of these numbers, it's likely prime.

### Divisibility by 11:
If the difference between the sum of the digits at odd places and the sum of the digits at even places is 0 or divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11.

### Square Root Approximation:
To approximate the square root of a number, start with an initial guess and then refine it using the formula:
\(x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \times (x_n + \frac{number}{x_n})\).
Iterate this formula, where \(x_0\) is the initial guess and \(x_{n+1}\) is the refined approximation.

These tricks can help make mental math and problem-solving more efficient across various mathematical operations.
